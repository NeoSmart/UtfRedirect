UtfRedirect is an application meant to proxy the execution of console
utilities and force their codepage to UTF8 to enable the reading and
writing of internationalized stdin and stdout between a host and slave
application.

UtfRedirect is developed and maintained by Mahmoud Al-Qudsi
<mqudsi@neosmart.net> of NeoSmart Technologies <http://neosmart.net/>


Usage:

UtfRedirect is to be run without any command line paramaters:

UtfRedirect.exe

Upon launch, UtfRedirect will be expecting two (2) lines of stdin
input. The first line is the name of the application, and the second
line is any command line arguments that the said application is to be
launched with. Both lines must be UTF8-encoded. After the second line
is entered, the specified application will be run and its stdout will
be piped back to the host application with a forced codepage of
UTF8/65001.
